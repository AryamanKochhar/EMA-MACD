# EMA-MACD-RSI 
an indicator involving ema bands +MACD(Moving Average Convergence divergence)+RSI
the basic idea is to use zero line pullbacks + rsi as a stratergy and give appropriate signals to the user

SIGNAL1 uses the macd as well as the 3 ema bands and 
signal2 uses the rsi indicator signalling 1 if the rsi<30 and  if rsi >70 -1
signal3 makes the and operation between the first two signals the signal is 1(SUGGESTING TO BUY and enter the market) if all the three conditions
-MACD<0 
-RSI<30
-AND the close price is in between the ema 1(ema line which takes the high ) and ema3(ema line which takes the lows )
